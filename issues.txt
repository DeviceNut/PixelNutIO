Carbon Components:
1) ToolTips: sliders knob bleeds through "whiting out" the text
2) CheckBox: first box is lower vertically than the others
3) RadioButton: on:click doesn't work?
4) RadioButtonGroup: on:click happens twice?
    and when it does 'selected' hasn't changed yet
    solution: use on:change with RadioButtonGroup
5) Select: using "inline" produces white background with white text (invisible)
6) Cannot use 'class' on components, but can use 'style'.
7) <SelectItem value={"0"} is broken!? And onchange fires with every change to the Sliders!!!

Svelte Issues:
1) Must surround statements with '$var' with {} in else clause (compiles to multiple statements).
   Perhaps these should be added automatically by the compiler?
2) $var in HTML vs var.get/get(var) in .js, why not preprocess .js and use $var there too?
3) Can get into infinite callback crash by changing $var inside if with $var.
4) Should be able to use CSS variables in .js code.
